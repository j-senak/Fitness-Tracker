# Fitness-Tracker

## Why
I wanted to develop an app that helps track the user's workouts. Hopegully, the user can use this to stay on track and record their workout progress.

## The Process
First I did was copy essential files, the front end was built already and I needed to focus on the database and backend. I made a server.js and models folder and began to work. Using boilerplate where needed, I set the basic server.js layout. The I made the workout.js and put in the schema I needed, using the seed.js to model it. Then exported it with my index.js. With that made, I added my html routes into the server.js. After those worked, I made the api routes needed to store data input. After tweaking and fixing breaks in my code, I deployed this to Heroku.
